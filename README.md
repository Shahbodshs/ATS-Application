# ATS-Application 
This is a project that you can use an application that uses two different models(based on the user's choice) to create a summary. 
The models are __Transformers__ and __GloVe__. 
##resources: 
I was able to fine-tune the Transformer model using this code: [GitHub](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lusfernandotorres/text-summarization-with-large-language-models/notebook). 
And also i downloaded the Word embeddings of __GloVe__ model from stanford university website : [GitHub](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
##Howto use? 
For using the application all you got to do is to go to the ats-application branch and download the folder and the codes, also download the word-embeddings and the fine-tuned version of Bert with the 
links above and lunch the code __functionality.py__ which runs an application which allows you to chose between the two models and summarize the text.
