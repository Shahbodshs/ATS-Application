# ATS-Application

This is a project that you can use an application that uses two different models (based on the user's choice) to create a summary. The models are __Transformers__ and __GloVe__.

## Resources
I was able to fine-tune the Transformer model using this code: [Bert](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lusfernandotorres/text-summarization-with-large-language-models/notebook).

And also I downloaded the Word embeddings of the __GloVe__ model from Stanford University website: [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).

## How to Use
For using the application, all you have to do is to go to the ats-application branch and download the folder and the codes. Also, download the word embeddings and the fine-tuned version of BERT with the links above. Then, launch the code __functionality.py__ which runs an application that allows you to choose between the two models and summarize the text.
